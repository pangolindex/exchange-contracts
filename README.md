# Pangolin Smart Contracts
This repo contains all of the smart contracts used to run [Pangolin](pangolin.exchange).

## Deployed Contracts
Factory address: `0xefa94DE7a4656D787667C749f7E1223D71E9FD88`

Router address: `0xE54Ca86531e17Ef3616d22Ca28b0D458b6C89106`

## Running
These contracts are compiled and deployed using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/). They can also be run using the Remix IDE. A tutorial for using Remix is located [here](https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/platform/deploy-a-smart-contract-on-avalanche-using-remix-and-metamask).

To prepare the dev environment, run `yarn install`. To compile the contracts, run `yarn compile`. Yarn is available to install [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable) if you need it.

**Please note** Currently Hedera does not support Hardhat. There are instructions for Hedera under `contracts/hedera/readme.md`


## Accessing the ABI
If you need to use any of the contract ABIs, you can install this repo as an npm package with `npm install --dev @pangolindex/exchange-contracts`. Then import the ABI like so: `import { abi as IPangolinPairABI } from '@pangolindex/exchange-contracts/artifacts/contracts/pangolin-core/interfaces/IPangolinPair.sol/IPangolinPair.json'`.

## Attribution
These contracts were adapted from these Uniswap repos: [uniswap-v2-core](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-core), [uniswap-v2-periphery](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-core), and [uniswap-lib](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-lib).

# Deployment

To deploy to any chain you want, you need to complete the following steps:
- [ ] Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your private key there
- [ ] Create a new configuration under `constants/NETWORK_NAME.js`
- [ ] Run the following command
```bash
yarn deploy [--network NETWORK_NAME]
```
The deployment script will deploy all the contracts and set them up according to the configuration file.

## Configuration

The deployment scripts gets chain specific configuration from the respective file in `constants/`. You can copy an existing configuration such as `constants/fantom_mainnet.js` when creating a configuration file for another chain. The deployer must be familiar with the purpose of each constant.

## Contracts

### Airdrop

The deployment script transfers the amount specified in the config to the Airdrop contract. But the script does not manage the whitelisting. To handle airdrop, the multisig **must** call `setWhitelister()` function of `Airdrop` to appoint a trusted individual to whitelist airdrop recipients using a bot. After multisig ensures that whitelist is accurate, it **must** call `allowClaiming()` to begin the airdrop.

### Treasury Vester

The deployment script transfers all the PNG (except what went to Airdrop) to `TreasuryVester`. After the deployment, the multisig **must** call `startVesting()` function of `TreasuryVester`. Then, a bot **must** be set up the ensure `distribute()` function of `TreasuryVester` is called every 24 hours. Vester allocation can only be changed through governance (timelock+multisig by default).

### PNG Staking

The deployment script sets up `FeeCollector` to manage funding of the PNG staking contract. A bot **must** be set up to call `harvest()` function of `FeeCollector` daily to divert MiniChef rewards to the PNG staking contract. The bot would also track swap fees accumulated in `FeeCollector` and call the `harvest()` function accordingly to distribute the swap fees to the recipients.

### Revenue Distributor

Portion of swap fees accumulated in `FeeCollector` is sent to `RevenueDistributor`. This contract allows anyone to call its `distributeToken` function to allocate revenue to pre-determined recipients. In default configuration, these recipients are the new DAO with 80% allocation, and Pangolin Foundation DAO with 20% allocation. The allocation can be later changed by the joint agreement of both DAOs, using the `JointMultisig` contract. Any future ERC20 revenue of the DAO **must** also be transferred to the Revenue Distributor.

### Mini Chef

The deployment script adds minimum two farms to MiniChef, based on the constants `PNG_STAKING_ALLOCATION`, `WETH_PNG_FARM_ALLOCATION`, and `INITIAL_FARMS`. `INITIAL_FARMS` is optional and can be left as an empty array. Multisig can later add or remove farms without timelock or governance.

# Faucets

## Aurora
Currently on Aurora you need to get funds into Goerli and then bridge across. You can do this by following these steps:
- Get some ETH from Chainlink Faucet https://faucets.chain.link/goerli
- Send ETH to Aurora via Rainbow Bridge https://testnet.rainbowbridge.app/

## BSC
Faucet: https://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smart
## Cronos
Faucet: https://cronos.crypto.org/faucet
Testnet Explorer: https://cronos.crypto.org/explorer/testnet3/

## Harmony
To get Harmony tokens on the testnet please go here https://faucet.pops.one/. **Please note** the Metamask address is different to your Harmony address, so you'll need to go to the Explorer to convert https://explorer.pops.one/

## Polygon (MATIC)
