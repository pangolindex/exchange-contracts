/**
 * @dev Interface for querying historical data from a Pool that can be used as a Price Oracle.
 *
 * This lets third parties retrieve average prices of tokens held by a Pool over a given period of time, as well as the
 * price of the Pool share token (BPT) and invariant. Since the invariant is a sensible measure of Pool liquidity, it
 * can be used to compare two different price sources, and choose the most liquid one.
 *
 * Once the oracle is fully initialized, all queries are guaranteed to succeed as long as they require no data that
 * is not older than the largest safe query window.

    // - PAIR_PRICE: the price of the tokens in the Pool, expressed as the price of the second token in units of the
    //   first token. For example, if token A is worth $2, and token B is worth $4, the pair price will be 2.0.
    //   Note that the price is computed *including* the tokens decimals. This means that the pair price of a Pool with
    //   DAI and USDC will be close to 1.0, despite DAI having 18 decimals and USDC 6.
    //
    // - BPT_PRICE: the price of the Pool share token (BPT), in units of the first token.
    //   Note that the price is computed *including* the tokens decimals. This means that the BPT price of a Pool with
    //   USDC in which BPT is worth $5 will be 5.0, despite the BPT having 18 decimals and USDC 6.
    //
    // - INVARIANT: the value of the Pool's invariant, which serves as a measure of its liquidity.
