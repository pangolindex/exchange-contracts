/**
 * @title Balancer Relayer
 * @notice Allows safe multicall execution of a relayer's functions
 * @dev
 * Relayers are composed of two contracts:
 *  - This contract, which acts as a single point of entry into the system through a multicall function.
 *  - A library contract, which defines the allowed behaviour of the relayer.
 *
 * The relayer entrypoint can then repeatedly delegatecall into the library's code to perform actions.
 * We can then run combinations of the library contract's functions in the context of the relayer entrypoint,
 * without having to expose all these functions on the entrypoint contract itself. The multicall function is
 * then a single point of entry for all actions, so we can easily prevent reentrancy.
 *
 * This design gives much stronger reentrancy guarantees, as otherwise a malicious contract could reenter
 * the relayer through another function (which must allow reentrancy for multicall logic), and that would
 * potentially allow them to manipulate global state, resulting in loss of funds in some cases:
 * e.g., sweeping any leftover ETH that should have been refunded to the user.
 *
 * NOTE: Only the entrypoint contract should be allowlisted by Balancer governance as a relayer, so that the
 * Vault will reject calls from outside the context of the entrypoint: e.g., if a user mistakenly called directly
 * into the library contract.
